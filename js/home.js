const para = `The Giza necropolis is situated in Greater Cairo (Egypt) and contains the Pyramid of Khufu 
(also known as the Great Pyramid of Giza), the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure.
\n.These pyramids were built between 2600 and 2500 BC during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt.
Alongside the pyramids lies iconic Sphinx, as well as three smaller pyramids known as the Queenâ€™s Pyramids.
The pyramids are assumed to have been made for the deceased pharaohs who ruled Ancient Egypt. 
Their bodies were kept alongside particular items that the deceased pharaohs would take to the afterlife.
It is said that the pyramids took 20 years to build, and according to the Greek historian Herodotus, 
who visited Giza in 450 BC, the pyramids were constructed by 400,000 men through the two decades.
Recent discoveries have uncovered mudbrick tombs of the labourers containing bread and wine, 
which were in close proximity to the pyramids itself.`;
