const para1 = `The Pyramid of Khufu, also known as the Great Pyramid of Giza, 
is the oldest and the largest of the pyramids in the Giza necropolis. 
It is also the oldest structure from the “Seven Wonders of the World”. 
The Pyramid of Khufu is made of an estimate 2.3 million large blocks, which weigh 6 million tonnes in total.
There are three known chambers in the pyramid, which are known as the Subterranean Chamber, the King’s Chamber, and the Queen’s Chamber.`;

const para2 = `The original entrance is located on the north side of the pyramid with a chevron design. 
According to the ancient Greek philosopher, Strabo, there was a movable stone which could be raised to go through this entrance.
The “Robber’s Tunnel” was cut straight through the rocks of the pyramid. 
The origin story of who did this is unknown, as scholars argue against the claim that the ninth-century Caliph, 
al-Ma’mun, was responsible for this.
The Subterranean Chamber is the lowest chamber and is dug into the bedrock beneath the pyramid.
The purpose of the Subterranean Chamber and the Queen’s Chamber is unknown, 
but the King’s Chamber contains an empty granite sarcophagus which is assumed to have contained Khufu’s mummy.`;
